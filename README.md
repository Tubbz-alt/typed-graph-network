Companion code to the Typed Graph Networks paper https://arxiv.org/abs/1901.07984
A model builder helper for creating graph networks akin to the ones described in https://arxiv.org/abs/1806.01261 and graph neural networks https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4700287.

To run the example model copy the tgn.py, mlp.py and util.py files to the repository.
